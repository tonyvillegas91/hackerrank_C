/*Objective
You are given an array of integers, marks, denoting the marks scored by students in a class.

The alternating elements marks0, marks2, marks4 and so on denote the marks of boys.
Similarly,marks1, marks3, marks5 and so on denote the marks of girls.
The array name, marks, works as a pointer which stores the base address of that array. In other words, marks contains the address where marks0 is stored in the memory.

For example, let marks = [3,2,5] and marks stores 0x7fff9575c05f. Then, 0x7fff9575c05f is the memory address of marks0.

Complete the function, marks_summation(int* marks, char gender, int number_of_students) which returns the total sum of:

marks of boys if gender = b
marks of girls if gender = g
The locked code stub reads the elements of marks along with gender. Then, it calls the function marks_summation(marks, gender, number_of_students) to get the sum of alternate elements as explained above and then prints the sum.

Input Format
The first line contains number_of_students, denoting the number of students in the class, hence the number of elements in marks.
Each of the number_of_students subsequent lines contains marks(i).
The next line contains gender.
Constraints
1 <= number_of_students <= 10^3
1 <= marks(i) <= 10^3 (where 0 <= i < number_of_students)
gender = g or b
Output Format
The output should contain the sum of all the alternate elements in marks as explained above.

5
b
Sample Output 0

8
Explanation 0

marks = [3, 2, 5] and gender = b.

So, marks0 + marks2 = 3 + 5 = 8.

g
Sample Output 1

6
Explanation 1

marks = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and gender = g 

So, sum = marks1 + marks3 = 2 + 4 = 6.

Sample Input 2

1
5
g
Sample Output 2

0
Explanation 2

marks = [5] and gender = g 
Here, marks1 does not exist. So, sum = 0.*/
